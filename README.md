Simple Static
==============
Simple Static is a tiny web server for testing static web pages. It is designed around testing and 
developing single page web apps, like with backbone, ember, angular etc. It handles mime-types, 
includes, etc.  It doesn't have any required config settings.  Just install it, and run it. It 
serves files out of the directory it is running in, and any files and folders that are included 
underneath.
